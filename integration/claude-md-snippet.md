## Project KG Integration

Before implementing anything non-trivial (new features, debugging, architecture changes), call `kg_context` with a 1-2 sentence description of what you're about to do. Use relevant findings to inform your work. After completing work that involved learning something new, capture it with `kg_add`. Report what you found and captured.
